        <h1>Learning about Spark Internals</h1>
        <p>Recently, I’ve been learning about how Spark works internally, which led me to the PhD dissertation of Matei Zaharia, about Resilient Distributed Datasets: <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-12.pdf">https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-12.pdf</a></p>
        <p>This feels like a key insight into his mental model:</p>
        <blockquote>
            “The insight behind RDDs is that although the workloads that MapReduce was unsuited for (e.g., iterative, interactive and streaming queries) seem at first very different, they all require a common feature that MapReduce lacks: efficient data sharing across parallel computation stages.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>RDDs keep data in RAM between computation steps. This is in contrast to MapReduce keeping intermediate data on disk.</p>
        <p>For an iterative algorithm, made of hundreds of computation steps, this can save a lot of I/O. Similarly, Interactive workloads require many reads (lots of exploratory queries), while streaming workloads require many writes (constantly adding new data), so keeping data in memory can be very helpful here too.</p>
        <p>Before Spark, there were specialised alternatives to MapReduce for iterative, interactive and streaming workloads, like HaLoop, Apache Impala and Apache Storm respectively. A lot of Spark's success is in the fact it is a single solution to all these cases.</p>
